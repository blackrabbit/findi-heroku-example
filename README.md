## Findi Heroku Example

This is an example of how to record the location of your phone with
[findi](https://github.com/pearkes/findi), a python library for
interacting with Apple's Find My iPhone API.

## Instructions

You can follow these instructions to create a service that will
periodically connect to the Find My iPhone API and store your location
in a database.

### Getting Setup

First, You'll need a terminal and the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

Once that's installed, change to a new directory and clone the source
of this project:

    $ git clone git@github.com:pearkes/findi-heroku-example.git
    $ cd findi-heroku-example/

### Creating the Heroku Application

Now we want to create a heroku app, and install some necessary addons:

    $ heroku create
    ...
    $ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev
    ...
    Attached as HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BROWN_URL

Pay attention to what your database "color" was. In this case, mine was
"brown".

Now, promote that database to be your primary:

    $ heroku heroku pg:promote HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BROWN_URL

And add one more addon:

    $ heroku addons:add scheduler:standard
    ...

### Configuring the Application

Now, you'll need to store your Apple ID and password in plain text as
environment variables in Heroku's system. **This is, of course, a security
risk, as you are storing your password on a 3rd party system**.

Confirm you still want to do this, and then add it as a config variable, replacing
Steve's credentials with yours:

    $ heroku config:add APPLE_EMAIL=steve@apple.com APPLE_PASSWORD=applerox
    ...

### Deploying

Now that we've got the Heroku app created and configured, you should
simply be able to:

    $ git push heroku master
    ...

Now, we want to create the database. You'll need to confirm this action:

    $ heroku run python bootstrap.py
    ...

### Setting up the Scheduler

    $ heroku addons:open scheduler

Your browser will open, and you may have to log in to Heroku.

In the scheduler mangagement interface, add a hourly job called
`python record_location.py`.

### Test Drive

    $ heroku run python record_location.py
    ...

You should see a message letting you know the location was sucesfully
stored. If not, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/pearkes/findi-heroku-example/issues/new).
